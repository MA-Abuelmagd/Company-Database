# Company-Database

Payrol program with accessing MYSQL Database and establishing connection through java.
I mainly used insert update delete functions but throgh java as I created these functions with taking input from the user for each column and then insert it directly in the database.
Also, I created a search reprots(select statements) with different critera but a fixed one and also when running the program it will guid the user and tell him/her what is the format of the input and what it really is (date,salary,department,...etc).
